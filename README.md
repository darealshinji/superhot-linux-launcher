This is a launcher for the Linux version of the game [SUPERHOT](http://superhotgame.com/) that I have written for fun.
It's intended to resemble the launcher from the Windows release.

Build dependencies on Ubuntu are: `cmake libx11-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxfixes-dev libpango1.0-dev`
